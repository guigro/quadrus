    <p>
        This agreement is made this 21st day of June, 2023, by and between Laurie Scheepers, the creator of Qwartel 
        (hereafter referred to as the "Developer"), and any and all potential litigants, third parties, users, or 
        entities who might claim a cause of action arising from the Developer's use, modification, or distribution 
        of Qwartel (collectively, the "Releasors").
    </p>
    <p>
        WHEREAS, the Developer has created Qwartel, an Afrikaans adaptation of Quordle, based on open source code

    </p>
    <p>
        WHEREAS, the original <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Quordle</a> was created by Freddie Meyer, who is hereby fully acknowledged and credited 
        as the author;

        </li>
        <li>
            The Developer commits to pay any and all revenues generated from the hosting of Qwartel on the site 
            <a href="https://qwartel.co.za" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">https://qwartel.co.za</a>, to Freddie Meyer in full.
        </li>

    <h2>2. Waiver and Release:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Releasors, by accessing, using, or engaging with Qwartel in any way, hereby waive, release, and 
            discharge any and all claims, damages, or liabilities, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, that 
            may arise from, or in connection with, the software, its modification, and use.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Agreement:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            By engaging with the Qwartel website or software, the Releasors are deemed to have read and agreed 
            to these terms, and waive any right to sue the Developer for any matters related to the software.
